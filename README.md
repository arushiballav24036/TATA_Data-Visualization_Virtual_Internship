# TATA(Data-Visualization)Virtual Internship
During this internship program , I completed a virtual internship at Tata where I consolidated and visualized sales, customer, and inventory data for online retail analysis. By analyzing customer behavior and purchase patterns, I identified key segments and optimized marketing efforts. Additionally, I created an interactive dashboard that provides real-time insights.

➡️Here are the tasks that were provided in this virtual internship:
## Task 1. Framing Business Scenarios:
- In this task a dataset was provided "Online Retail Store Dataset" to analyze the data and frame impactful questions for the CEO and CMO. 
- This exercise enhanced my data analysis and question formulation skills.
## Task 2. Choosing the Right Visuals:
- Through multiple-choice questions, I gained knowledge on selecting appropriate graphs and charts that effectively represent data. This helped me to understand the importance of visualizing data accurately.
## Task 3. Creating Effective Visuals:
- I delved into Power-BI and explored various techniques to create the visuals for this project to ensure that the data was presented clearly and insights could be easily understood, in order to create a comprehensive dashboard.
## Task 4. Communicating Insights and Analysis:
- I identified areas for improvement and effectively conveying findings and insights. This project emphasized the importance of clear communication in data visualization.

### Project Overview
  - The project involved gathering business requirements from stakeholders, pre-processing the dataset, and creating a data visualization with business intelligence requirements.
  - This dashboard is divided into two sections as Revenue analysis and Quantity analysis. This helps to analyze the overall data in two different perspective.
### Data Source:
  Online Retail Data : This data is from Virtual Internship on Forage from Tata Group on "Data Visualization: Empowering Business with Effective Insights".
### Tools Used:
  - Excel
  - Power BI
### Project Dashboard includes
- Dashboard 1 : Details of Revenue
- Dashboard 2 : Details of Quantity Sold 
### Key Insights:
#### 1. Data Analysis and Cleaning:
   - Imported the Dataset into Power BI
   - To identify key variables and ensure accurate analysis, the exploratory analysis of dataset structure and data types has been done using the Power Query editor in Power BI.
   -  Handled the missing values, cleaned the data, and transformed it as needed.
   -  DAX has been used to compute essential metrics such as total revenue, total products and total quantities.
   -  A series of insightful charts has been created to effectively communicate the findings.
#### 2. Key metrics overview:
  -  Analyzing the entire data for the year 2011, the online retail business has gained 9.84M revenue, 372K customers, 5229K total quantity and has 3.9K products.
#### 3. Seasonal Trends:
   - In dashboard 1, the data shows that the increase in revenue starts in the month of September. This trend continues till the month of November where it reached
     1.51 million USD, the highest during the entire year. This analysis shows, that the retail store sales are impacted by the seasonality which usually occurs in 
     the last 4 months of the year.
   - In dashboard 2, the total quantity showed a consistent upward trend from the month of July to November indicating strong demand growth. The highest quantity 
     is recorded in the month of November.
#### 4. Country wise Revenue Analysis:
- The visual shows how the top 10 countries which have opportunities for growth are performing. The analysis shows that, countries such as the Netherlands, Ireland, Germany and France have high volumes of units bought and revenue generated.     
#### 5. Customer Analysis by Revenue:
- The analysis shows that, there is not much of a difference between the purchases made by the top 10 customers. The highest revenue generating customer only purchased 7% more than the 2nd highest which shows that the business is not relying only on a few customers to generate the revenue. This shows that, the bargaining power of customers is low and the business is in a good position.
#### 6. Customer Analysis by Quantity:
- The analysis shows that, the top 3 customers contribute significantly to the overall quantity and after that there is not so much difference between the other customers.
#### 7. Regional Analysis by Revenue:
- It can be seen that, countries such as Netherlands, Ireland, Germany, France and Australia are generating high revenue and the company should invest more in these areas to increase demand for products. Africa and Asia do not have any demand for the products, along with Russia.
#### 8. Regional Analysis by Quantity:
- The highest quantities were observed in Countries such as Netherlands, Ireland, Germany, France and Australia, indicating strong demand in these areas.The company allocating more resources to top-performing regions to maximize sales, while exploring targeted strategies, such as promotional offers or localized marketing, to boost performance in underperforming areas.
#### 9. Revenue by Top 5 Products:
- Product Dotcom Postage is leading the way, contributing 26.31% of total revenue. These top 5 products collectively account for 100% of the overall revenue, highlighting their importance to the business. To maintain and boost revenue,the company should expand the product line, increasing marketing efforts.
#### 10. Revenue by Top 5 Quantity:
- Product Paper Craft, Little Birdie led the list with the highest quantity compared to other 4 products. This indicates strong demand for these specific products. - There is a noticeable gap between the top 3 products and the remaining 2 in the top 5. This suggests that while some products are performing exceptionally well, others may need further optimization.
