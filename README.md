# TATA(Data-Visualization)Virtual Internship
During this internship program , I completed a virtual internship at Tata where I consolidated and visualized sales, customer, and inventory data for online retail analysis. By analyzing customer behavior and purchase patterns, I identified key segments and optimized marketing efforts. Additionally, I created an interactive dashboard that provides real-time insights.

➡️Here are the tasks that were provided in this virtual internship:
## Task 1. Framing Business Scenarios:
- In this task a dataset was provided "Online Retail Store Dataset" to analyze the data and frame impactful questions for the CEO and CMO. 
- This exercise enhanced my data analysis and question formulation skills.
## Task 2. Choosing the Right Visuals:
- Through multiple-choice questions, I gained knowledge on selecting appropriate graphs and charts that effectively represent data. This helped me to understand the importance of visualizing data accurately.
## Task 3. Creating Effective Visuals:
- I delved into Power-BI and explored various techniques to create the visuals for this project to ensure that the data was presented clearly and insights could be easily understood, in order to create a comprehensive dashboard.
## Task 4. Communicating Insights and Analysis:
- I identified areas for improvement and effectively conveying findings and insights. This project emphasized the importance of clear communication in data visualization.
